# Smart Contract

Creating smart contracts using the thirdweb cli.

## Overview

Install the CLI package globally to use the commands anywhere on your system.

Note: If you do not wish to install it globally, you can prefix each command with npx. i.e. ```npx thirdweb <command>```.

```sh
npm i -g thirdweb
```

Once installed, you can view the full list of available commands by running:

To login, get your API from thirdweb.com.

```sh
npx thirdweb deploy -k <Secrete API Key>

From there you can select a contract, you have an option select an empty or a prebuilt contract of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155.
